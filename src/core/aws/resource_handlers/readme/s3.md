## 🗄️ Strategy for `S3ResourceHandlers` Class

The strategy for identifying **unused S3 buckets** is as follows:

1. List all S3 buckets using the `list_buckets` method of the `S3` client.
2. For each bucket, get the number of requests using the `get_number_of_requests` method of the `CloudWatch` client.
3. If the number of requests is 0, add the bucket to the list of unused S3 buckets.
4. Return the list of unused S3 buckets.
